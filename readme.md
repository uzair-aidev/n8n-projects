# n8n Projects

This repository contains a collection of my n8n projects. Each project is designed to automate a specific task or workflow.

1.  Go to your n8n instance.
2.  Click on the "New" button and then "Import from File".
3.  Select the `.json` file for the project you want to import.
4.  Configure the credentials and other settings as needed.
